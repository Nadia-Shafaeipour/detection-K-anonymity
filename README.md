# detection-K-anonymity
Python implementation of Understanding the protection of privacy when counting subway travelers through anonymization


## Counting travelers movement
This repository contains two files: a CSV file and a Python code. These files are used to analyze the movement of travelers between departure epochs and arrival epochs.

Input Data (CSV File)
The CSV file (test.csv) contains a small sample of data that serves as input for the Python code. This data represents the travelers' movement information, including the departure time and location and the corresponding arrival time and location.

Python Code (k-anonymity.py)
The Python code (e.g., k-anonymity.py) processes the data from the CSV file and calculates the number of travelers that moved from each departure epoch to each arrival epoch. To obtain the output, simply run the k-anonymity.py script.
```
k-anonymity.py
```
Instructions
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Download or clone this repository.
Place your data in the CSV file (test.csv), following the same format as the provided sample data.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.
Run the Python script using the following command:
python k-anonymity.py
The output will be displayed, showing the number of travelers for each departure epoch and arrival epoch.
Data Protection Notice:

In order to prioritize data protection and privacy, we have not uploaded the exact Beijing subway data as input for this project. Instead, we have provided a small sample of data in the CSV file (test.csv) to demonstrate the functionality of the Python code. The purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation of a k-anonymity algorithm for travelers' movement analysis, while respecting privacy regulations and ethical considerations. Please ensure that any data you use with this project complies with relevant data protection laws and regulations.
